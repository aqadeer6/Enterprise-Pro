Saif and Haider finalised the SRS document and Qais, Saadia and Daniyal have made significant progress in developing the SDD document
by completing the introduction, functional requirements such as User authentication and non- functional requirements.
Ghuffran and Qadeer have started their contribution to the front end development by creating a home login page and choosing a colour scheme.
Next week we will look to build on the progress and summarise and explain to the team what we need to do expand on.

This meeting was arranged to check the progress from the last meeting. Every member is on track with their tasks
Last meetings deadline of 5th of April had to be extended to 6th of April as we had some difficulty, with the unit testing
and acceptance testing, so Qadeer, Qais, and Saif requested in the group if the deadline could be brought forward to the 7th.
Saadia has been helping out with the documentation as well as hosting and updating the team minutes.
Haider, Ghuffran and Danyial have cleaned up some minor errors found in the code, as they have completed 
the code inspection documentation and are almost done with the report.
The next deadline is the 9th of April and for that deadline we want to have completed everything, and pushed all our code 
to the main branch in github, ready for submission.
The next meeting is schedualed to be the last one, before submission.

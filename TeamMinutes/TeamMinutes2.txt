All the team members arrived on time and we began to work through our ideas for potential questions for the upcoming meeting with the client which was scheduled on 04/02/2025 from 14:00 - 14:20 in Horton D 1.04. 
Each team member came up with different questions to be asked in our meeting with the client but our primary focus was to ensure we understood the main functional requirements.
We allocated our team members to ask a question each to ensure we all got the information we needed to work efficiently on our project.
We agreed to both voice record and take notes so we do not miss any crucial information.

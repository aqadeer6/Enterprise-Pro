Qadeer and Ghufran had completed with their work on the front end and felt that the interface had met the standerds, as well as 
the clients contract requirments. all the features were reviewed by the team collectively until we were satisfied with the progress.


the team collectively reviewed the deadlines ansd milestones as provided on the gant chart, we evaluated the outlines for tasks,
and concluded that the plan of action and progress of tasks was very much on track. as well as completing the gant chart, Daniyal, Qais and Saadia
also had finalised the Use case diagrams and SRS and SDD.

Haider and Saif made significant progress by establishing the server enviroment and creating a database, we faced some challanges when 
connecting the front end to the backend, so despite the progress, it is not yet fully functional.

as a whole we are very delighted with the progress being made, by each member, especially when taking into account some of the challenges faced,
the prototype is now ready for submission.

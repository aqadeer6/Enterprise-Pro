After our meeting with the client, we had a strong grasp and understanding of our clients specification. We also ensured
that we firmly understood the desired contract requirments. In this meeting we assigned tasks and delegated different parts of the project 
to all team members, as well as this we made sure that all the team members were on the same page in terms of what the client would like the 
system to function like, as well as other features.

Plan For Next Week: to review progress of each team member, as well as evaluate any changes needing to be made.

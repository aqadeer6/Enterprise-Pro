Following up on last weekâ€™s discussion, all team members agreed to finalise the front-end and back-end code by March 20th so that the team leader can assign tasks for the next assessment due in Week 12.

However, some team members are still facing challenges and are behind schedule. Ghufran and Qadeer are currently working on fixing the PHP Mailer, as they encountered issues with the password reset file.

Saif and Haider have completed the tasks assigned to them in the previous meeting, but after reviewing their work as a group, we decided to dedicate more time to refining it.

Meanwhile, Qais, Saadia, and Danyal, who were responsible for cleaning up the existing code and ensuring comments were properly placed, have completed their tasks and are now waiting for their next assignment.

The next and final deadline set by the team leader is the 25th of March.

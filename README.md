(Web - interface to interact with assets)
For now we made 2 test users for testing purpose because members who were supposed to start backend got sick and we went behind so for now test users so pages are easy to access.
Test User:
hello@gmail.com
Bradford123
Test Admin:
admin
admin123
Due to VS and Github options we couldnt upload everything seperatly as it was causing problems so we all uploaded from one system which made things easy.
